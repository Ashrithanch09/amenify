variables : A B
constants : none
axiom  : A {starting character string}
rules  : (A → AB), (B → A)
which produces:
n = 0 : S=A
n = 1 : S=AB
n = 2 : S=ABA
n = 3 : S=ABAAB
n = 4 : S=ABAABABA
n = 5 : S=ABAABABAABAAB
Here's a Python class LSystem designed to represent L-systems Using the provided L-system (Cantor fractal) where n=3:
class LSystem:
    def __init__(self, variables, axiom, rules):
        self.variables = variables
        self.axiom = axiom
        self.rules = rules
    
    def produce(self, n):
        current_string = self.axiom
        for _ in range(n):
            new_string = ""
            for char in current_string:
                if char in self.variables:
                    new_string += self.rules[char]
                else:
                    new_string += char
            current_string = new_string
        return current_string
cantor_fractal = LSystem(variables={'A', 'B'}, axiom='A', rules={'A': 'ABA', 'B': 'BBB'})
result = cantor_fractal.produce(3)
print("Result for n=3:", result)

output should be:
Result for n=3: ABAABBBABAABBBABAABBBABAABBBABAABBBABAABBB

The space complexity of this implementation is O(n), where n is the number of iterations. 
The time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the number of iterations and m is the length of the resulting string at each iteration.
To optimize the solution,we can consider memoization. Since the L-system rules typically produce the same strings for the same inputs, you can cache the results of each iteration to avoid recalculating them. 
This can significantly reduce both time and space complexity, making the algorithm more efficient for large values of n.
