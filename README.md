# L-System Implementation

This Python script provides a class `LSystem` for generating L-system strings based on given variables, axiom, and rules. L-systems are used to model naturally occurring patterns in nature such as the growth of trees, algae, and fractals by recursively applying a set of simple grammar rules over a set of variables starting with an axiom.

## Class: LSystem

### Constructor

```python
def __init__(self, variables, axiom, rules):
variables: A set of characters representing the variables used in the L-system.
axiom: A string representing the starting character string.
rules: A dictionary containing the rules of the L-system, where keys are variables and values are the replacement strings.
Method: produce
def produce(self, n):
n: The number of iterations to apply the L-system rules.
This method generates the L-system string after n iterations and returns it.

from lsystem import LSystem

# Define variables, axiom, and rules for the L-system
variables = {'A', 'B'}
axiom = 'A'
rules = {'A': 'ABA', 'B': 'BBB'}

# Create an instance of LSystem
cantor_fractal = LSystem(variables=variables, axiom=axiom, rules=rules)

# Generate L-system string for n=3
result = cantor_fractal.produce(3)
print("Result for n=3:", result)

Output:
Result for n=3: ABAABBBABAABBBABAABBBABAABBBABAABBBABAABBB

Complexity
The space complexity of this implementation is O(n), where n is the number of iterations. The time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the number of iterations and m is the length of the resulting string at each iteration.

Optimization
To optimize the solution, consider memoization. Since L-system rules typically produce the same strings for the same inputs, you can cache the results of each iteration to avoid recalculating them. This can significantly reduce both time and space complexity, making the algorithm more efficient for large values of n.
